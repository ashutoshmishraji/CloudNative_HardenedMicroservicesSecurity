>> How will you test the changes?
While making a plan for setting up kubernetes cluster, my main focus would be on pod security policies, as with this we can avoid the risk as much as possible at the pod level itself. I  would also to enforce few policies like preventing privileged containers, rejection of containers that allow root execution and main thing hardening applications in the kubernetes cluster itself. For test simultaion, i would like to create/execute containers with root access (basically root users) which will act as dummy attack and i will also enforce pod security which will reject containers that are trying to execute things as a root user. Now in this scenario, our cluster should identify the risk and should fail, keeping our pods and its data safe. We can also use kube-bench and test the nodes on the cluster. In such case, if there are any vulnerabilities/threats, they can be addressed before hand only. Even docker images used for creating pods also should be scanned for vulnerabilities.


>> How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
Grafana is a very nice/helpful tool. In order to ensure that changes should not have negative affect on our cluster, we can setup Grafana. It will monitor our pods, their health from the starting only. This can make testing and adding new aspects to the cluster more difficult since adding images could be harder but without that security, there is a higher chance of a security breach/new threats.

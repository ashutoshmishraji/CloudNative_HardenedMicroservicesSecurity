1. Incident commander name:
Ashutosh Mishra

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
There were Three pods with three different crypto miners (minergate, moneropool, and xmrpooldotnet) were launched on our kubernetes cluster.

3. Summary of what was affected:
The attacker was able to get control of our kubernetes cluster and could run crypto miners (minergate, moneropool, and xmrpooldotnet) containers on the cluster. Attackers was after compute resources to abuse for crypto-mining.

4. Summary of the impact:
Undesirable situation is , attacker  managed to run crypto miners (minergate, moneropool, and xmrpooldotnet) on our kubernetes cluster.  Usually, crypto-mining consumes a lot of resources like CPU. The CPU usage jumps into 99% utilization, which impacts all services' performance on the cluster. Its also means the attacker was able to get control of our cluster and run these containers on the cluster. The Kubernetes/compute resources dashboard in Grafana shows the significant spike and increase in CPU utilization, this is related to the crypto miners being started.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
>> Our administrator run the following command to evict the crypto miner pods:
"kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force>".  It will evicted the miner pods and CPU utilization fell to the pre-incident levels as the crypto mining pods are evicted and deleted.

>> All accessed credentials regarding kubernetes credentials are being rotated/refreshed, this is a precautionary measure given the attacker was able to run the pods and therefore   we have access to an administrative terminal, kube config file or UI.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
>> We  must use the monitoring tools like grafana
>> We Should make admission controllers to allow only certain images to be imported and started within the pods.
